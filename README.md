## 🎬 How to run

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babakjan/Moneybag-BE.git
cd Moneybag-BE/
```

### Start database

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Start the app

- Create database schema - open `./src/main/resources/application.properties` find the following lines and (un)comment them
  to look like this:
    ```
    #spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
    ```
- Run the app (app will run on http://localhost:8000/api)
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
- If you want to initiate the database with test data, stop the app and undo the changes you've done in the application
  properties file,
  plus make sure, that the following line is uncommented
  ```
  spring.sql.init.mode=always
  ```
- run the app again
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
- If you want to run the app repeatedly, comment the previously uncommented line because you don't want to insert test data
  every time you restart the app.
